 GromacsWrapper gromacs.analysis
=================================

The ``gromacs.analysis`` package contains **legacy code** from
GromacsWrapper_. It consists of an experimental plugin architecture
to perform various analysis functions using the Gromacs_
tools. However, this approached turned out to be overly complicated
and hard to maintain. Since GromacsWrapper release 0.7.0 it is *not*
included in GromacsWrapper anymore and at the moment it is **not
maintained**.

This repository does not contain a fully installable Python package,
only the code (and old docs) in case anyone wants to use it or
maintain it. All code is made available under the GNU General Public
License, version 3 (or any higher version), see file COPYING for the
full text of the license.
